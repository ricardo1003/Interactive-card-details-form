- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

I learned something new doing this project. By looking online for help making the number input have an space each 4 numbers, i discovered a thing called "regex", it is like a way to select string characters and it can shorten your code by a lot. I investigated a bit of how it worked and tried to make my own attempt until it worked.

### Continued development

On future projects, I will try to use regex more wherever I can, so I can improve and make shorter coe.
